**Prerequisites**

Operating System: macOS with Apple Silicon

Dependency: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) must be installed and running locally.


1. **Download the Installation Script:**
Ensure you have access to the terminal.\
Download the following installation script into a directory on your machine from our repo.
2. **Run the Installation Script:**
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the install_node.sh script is saved.\
Make the script executable by running:


```
chmod +x install_node.sh
./install_node.sh
```
3. **Update Shell Configuration:**

The script will automatically create an alias named init-infera for running the Infera node.

If you are using Zsh, youâ€™ll need to manually add the alias to your ~/.zshrc file with the following:

```
echo "alias init-infera='~/infera'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

4. **Running Infera Node:**

Once everything is installed with the shell configured, you can start the Infera node by running the following command:

```
init-infera
```
