        Galadriel’s devnet is out now. During devnet you can build working on-chain AI agents and applications. What can
        you
        expect during devnet:

        * We are iterating the product fast along with user needs so things are changing rapidly;
        * We expect to make many big architectural changes during the devnet as the full chain spec is yet to be
        implemented;
        * Devnet is alpha stage, it’s not persistent and things might break;
        * We are progressively moving towards decentralization.

        <p className={"parMar"}>**Testnet: upcoming**</p>

        After the validation of the design and architecture during devnet, we aim to lock the chain spec and release a
        testnet. What can you expect during testnet:
        * Chain spec is completed and fully functional;
        * Biggest upgrade will be in bringing AI inference on the validator level so the network can achieve highest
        security and verifiability guarantees;
        * Testnet is incentivized so devs can already deploy the AI apps & agents which they want to go live during
        mainnet.

        Following the successful iterations and invaluable feedback garnered through our testnet phase, we will launch
        Galadriel’s mainnet. What can you expect during launch of mainnet:
        * Stress testing, code frozen and security audits completed;
        * Expanding validator network;
        * Incentive programs for developers.
