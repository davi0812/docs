InferaSDK is a Python package that provides a fast, flexible, and intuitive interface for interacting with the Infera API. It aims to simplify the process of submitting jobs, processing multiple requests concurrently, and retrieving results efficiently from various language models.

---

### Main Features

Here are just a few of the things that InferaSDK does well:
- Asynchronous API interactions for efficient processing
- Concurrent job submission and handling
- Easy integration with multiple language models
- Automatic job status polling and result retrieval
- Flexible parameter configuration for each job (e.g., max_output, temperature)
- Timeout handling to manage long-running requests

---

### Installation
Install InferaSDK using pip:
```
pip install InferaSDK
```

---

### Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use InferaSDK:
``` python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
from inferaSDK import InferaSDK

async def main():
    api_key = "your_api_key_here"  # Replace with your actual API key
    sdk = InferaSDK(api_key)

    model = "llama3.1:latest"
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]
    max_output = 100
    temperature = 0.7

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        result = await sdk.process_job(session, model, messages, max_output, temperature)

        print("Result:")
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
This code demonstrates how to use the InferaSDK to submit a job to the Infera API and retrieve the result. Let's break it down:

1. **Import statements**
* ```asyncio```: Used for asynchronous programming in Python.
* ```aiohttp```: An asynchronous HTTP client library.
* ```InferaSDK```: The main class from the InferaSDK package.

---

2. **SDK initialization**
* Creates an instance of ```InferaSDK``` with your API key.

---

3. **Job parameters**
* ```model```: Specifies the language model to use (in this case, "llama3.1:latest").
* ```messages```: A list containing a single message dictionary with the user's question.
* ```max_output```: Limits the maximum number of tokens in the response.
* ```temperature```: Controls the randomness of the output (0.7 is a balanced setting).

---

4. **Asynchronous context manager**
* ```async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:``` Creates an HTTP session for making API requests.

---

5. **Job processing**
* ```result = await sdk.process_job(...):``` Submits the job to the API and waits for the result.

---

6. **Result output**
- Prints the result received from the API.

---

7. **Script execution**
* ```if __name__ == "__main__"::``` Ensures the script runs only when executed directly.
* ```asyncio.run(main()):``` Runs the asynchronous main function.


This example showcases a simple, single-job submission to the Infera API using the InferaSDK, demonstrating how to interact with AI models asynchronously.
