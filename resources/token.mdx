The Infera token **(INFER)** is issued by the Infera Network, serving as the primary medium of value exchange for participants within the ecosystem.

---

## INFER Utility
---

### Payment for Inference services
   - INFER is used as the primary payment method for AI inference tasks on the Infera network. Developers pay in INFER to access compute power from nodes for running their AI models.
---
### Node participation rewards
   - Nodes contributing their computational resources to the Infera network earn INFER tokens as compensation for their work. The more tasks a node completes, the more $INFER it earns.
---

### Staking & slashing mechanism
   - Node operators are required to stake INFER tokens as collateral to participate in the network. This staking mechanism ensures nodes maintain high performance and reliability, as poor performance may result in slashing (losing a portion of staked tokens).
---

### Governance
   - INFER holders can participate in network governance, voting on key proposals and decisions that shape the future of the Infera ecosystem.
---

### Access to premium features
   - Developers and enterprises can use INFER tokens to unlock advanced features, access premium support, or utilize higher-tier inference services on the network.
