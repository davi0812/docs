**Utility**
The \$INFER token is a key that unlocks access to an array of services, including the chatbot, Telegram bot, API, and Oracle, creating a natural demand for the token. Users must hold a minimum balance of $INFER in their wallets to utilize these innovative products.

Moreover, $INFER token holders are granted the privilege to participate in shaping the future of the platform by voting on the code of ethics. This integral aspect of the Large Language Model and ecosystem empowers users with full autonomy to influence developments and amendments, ensuring the community's values are reflected in our advancements.

**Governance**
Token holders are empowered to cast their votes on pivotal governance proposals. This encompasses critical aspects such as modifications to the core model, updates to the infrastructure, and adjustments in tokenomics. This participatory approach ensures that key decisions reflect the collective wisdom and preferences of the community, fostering a transparent and collaborative ecosystem.
