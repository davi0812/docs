**How is compute billing calculated?**
* All spend is in $INFER but pegged to USD prices
* Developers pay per token (tokens are the input/output of an LLM model)
* Allows corporate users to budget in USD instead of $INFER expanding our user base

**What is the cost to use the Infera API?**
* The Infera API will be free to use in our alpha phase of our network launch.
* Pricing will be released after the roll out of our beta pahse for the network.

**What does onramp look like?**
* Direct credit card payment solution for developers
* 5% reserved for CC processing and onramp, 95% used to purchase INFER tokens
* Crypto Native projects can buy $INFER on a DEX and execute LLM inference directly on the network

**How does $INFER accrue value over the long-term?**

* 20% of the developer spend is used to buy back + burn tokens and manage operations
* 80% of spend is delivered to the miners for operations
